# Overview

I am a Software Developer trying expand my learning in programming.

This is a Hello World program written in Javascript using a HTML template, showing integration with VSC and Javascript.

The program was created to do end to end integration with Visual Studio Code (VSC) and Github.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
